# Academy Library SQL Database
This repo contains several TSQL scripts to create, populate and work with data in a library database.
The database contains sample data that simulates what you might find in a book lending library. This includes info about books, authors, publishers, borrowers, library branches and book loans.
This was done entirely with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and SQL Server 2017.
